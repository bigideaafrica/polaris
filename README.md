   choco install git-lfs
   
   # For Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
   sudo apt install git-lfs
   
   # For macOS (using Homebrew)
   brew install git-lfs
   ```

2. **Clone with LFS**: Then clone the repository:
   ```
   git lfs install
   git clone https://github.com/bigideaafrica/polaris_distributions.git
   ```

3. **Pull Large Files**: If you've already cloned, run:
   ```
   git lfs pull
   ```
