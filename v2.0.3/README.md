# Polaris Node Manager v2.0.3

**Advanced Real-Time Monitoring System** - Complete visibility into your mining operations

Polaris Node Manager v2.0.3 introduces a revolutionary monitoring system that provides comprehensive real-time health checks and performance tracking for all your mining machines. This release builds upon the solid foundation of v2.0.2's connection infrastructure while adding powerful monitoring capabilities.

## üöÄ What's New in v2.0.3

### **Advanced Real-Time Monitoring System**

The centerpiece of v2.0.3 is a comprehensive monitoring system that continuously checks the health and status of your mining resources. This system provides four key monitoring capabilities:

#### 1. **Connection Monitoring (TCP Results)**
- **Real-time connectivity testing**: Tests whether the Polaris server can actually reach your mining machine over the internet
- **Round-trip time (RTT) measurements**: Shows connection speed in milliseconds
- **Status indicators**: Connected/Down/Error with color-coded visual feedback
- **Connection health tracking**: Continuous monitoring of network accessibility
- **Why it matters**: Ensures your machine is accessible to receive mining tasks from the network

#### 2. **Authentication Monitoring (Auth Results)**
- **Credential verification**: Verifies that the Polaris server can successfully log into your machine using your credentials
- **Authentication response time**: Shows how quickly authentication completes in milliseconds
- **Status tracking**: Success/Failed/Auth Error with detailed error information
- **Real-time validation**: Continuous checking of authentication status
- **Why it matters**: Confirms your machine credentials are working and tasks can be executed remotely

#### 3. **Proof of Work (PoW) Results**
- **Performance testing**: Regularly tests your machine's computing performance to ensure it meets network requirements
- **Separate CPU and GPU scoring**: Individual performance metrics for both processing units
- **Total performance calculation**: Combined score with tier qualification status
- **Threshold validation**: Checks if your machine passes the minimum threshold (0.005)
- **Status indicators**: Qualified/Not Qualified with detailed performance breakdown
- **Why it matters**: Ensures your machine maintains the required performance standards to earn rewards

#### 4. **Docker Environment Monitoring**
- **Installation verification**: Checks that Docker (containerization software) is properly installed
- **Service status monitoring**: Verifies Docker service is running and accessible
- **Version information**: Displays Docker version and configuration details
- **User permissions checking**: Ensures proper Docker access permissions
- **Status tracking**: Installed/Not Installed and Running/Stopped indicators
- **Why it matters**: Many mining tasks require Docker containers, so this ensures your environment is ready

### **Visual Status Dashboard**

The monitoring system provides an intuitive visual interface:

- **Color-coded status indicators**: 
  - üü¢ Green: OK/Connected/Qualified
  - üî¥ Red: Error/Down/Not Qualified
  - üü° Yellow: Warning/Attention Required
- **Compact view**: Small status badges in the machines list for quick overview
- **Detailed view**: Expandable tooltips with comprehensive diagnostic information
- **Global status indicator**: Shows overall health of all your machines at a glance
- **Timestamp tracking**: Shows when checks were last performed and response times

### **Automatic Health Checks**

The system operates automatically:
- **Periodic monitoring**: Runs health checks on all registered machines at regular intervals
- **Real-time updates**: Status updates without user intervention
- **Early warning system**: Identifies potential issues before they impact earnings
- **Performance trending**: Tracks performance metrics over time
