## Using v2.0.2 Features

### Setting Up SSH Connections (New in v2.0.2)

1. **Add New Machine**:
   - Click "Add Machine" in the main interface
   - Enter machine details (IP, username, etc.)

2. **SSH Key Setup** (Choose one method):
   
   **Method 1: Direct Key Input (Recommended)**
   - Paste your SSH private key directly into the "SSH Private Key" text area
   - The system will validate and process the key securely
   
   **Method 2: Load from File**
   - Click "Load Key from File" button
   - Select your private key file (.pem, .key, or id_rsa)
   - The key content will be loaded automatically

3. **Connect**:
   - Click "Connect" to establish the connection
   - The new API-based system will handle authentication
   - Monitor connection status in real-time

### Enhanced Security Features

- **Secure Key Storage**: Private keys are processed securely without permanent storage
- **Connection Validation**: Automatic validation of SSH credentials before connection
- **Error Recovery**: Improved error handling with suggested fixes
- **Session Management**: Better handling of connection sessions and timeouts

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- **Problem**: SSH connection fails
- **Solution**: Verify SSH key format and ensure OpenSSH client is installed

### Key Loading Issues
- **Problem**: Cannot load SSH key from file
- **Solution**: Ensure key file has proper permissions (600) and correct format

### API Connection Issues
- **Problem**: API-based connection fails
- **Solution**: Check internet connectivity and firewall settings

## Migration from v2.0.1
